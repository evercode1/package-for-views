**ViewMaker** is for use with the Laravel PHP framework (5.2 and up). It's a plugin for the artisan command line 
tool that ships with Laravel, providing ready-made templates, designed to optimize your work flow.

**ViewMaker** does more than just create views.  The **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command builds a foundation for you by creating a model from 
scratch with corresponding migration, routes, api, controllers and views, forming a basic crud app, with searchable, 
sortable columns.  It also builds a basic unit test and sets up your factory for quick population of seed data.

If you just want to create views quickly, the **[make:views](#makeviews)** command that lets you scaffold views for create, show, edit, and index, 
based on your input.  You simply input a model name, master page name and template type (plain, basic, dt, or vue), 
and the view folder and corresponding views are made for you instantly.  Our dt and vue templates come with working
js datagrids out of the box.  Check out our [template types](#template-types) section for details on the tempaltes.
 
**ViewMaker** also creates a **[make:master](#makemaster)** command that creates a layouts folder and builds a master page,
with the individual parts separated out into view partials.  It comes with a minimal bootstrap implementation
and all of the required dependecies.  This makes working with our other commands, like **[make:views](#makeviews)** and 
**[make:foundation](#makefoundation)**, even more simple, because the dependencies and configuration
are done for you.  

This package also ships with a **[make:crud](#makecrud)** command, which creates the model, migration, routes, controllers, factory, and test
without the views, in case you want to create those separately.

With these commands, you can stand a project up quickly.  For example, you could use **[make:master](#makemaster)** to 
create your master page, and then use **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** to stand up all the crud and views that you 
need to have an instant crud app in less than a minute.

The commands are incredibly easy to use, nevertheless, I have included very thorough documentaion and a work-flow tutorial, so
that programmers of all levels can use this tool.  I hope you enjoy this plugin and find it useful.  I donâ€™t have a donate button, 
but If you would like to support my work and learn more about Laravel, you can do so by buying one of my books, 
**[Laraboot: laravel 5.2 For Beginners](https://leanpub.com/laravel-5-for-beginners-laraboot)**, I really appreciate it.

## Install ##

Via Composer

```
composer require evercode1/view-maker
```

In your app/config/app.php file, add the following to the providers array:

```
Evercode1\ViewMaker\ViewMakerServiceProvider::class,
```

## Usage

## Summary

ViewMaker will install 4 artisan commands, **[make:views](#makeviews)**, **[make:master](#makemaster)**, **[make:crud](#makecrud)**, and **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)**.

Use **[make:views](#makeviews)** to create views, including:

* appropriately-named view folder
* index 
* create
* edit
* show 
 
Use **[make:master](#makemaster)** to create a master page, which includes:
 
 * layouts folder
 * master (you give it your name) 
 * meta partial
 * css partial
 * scripts partial
 * bottom partial
 * nav partial
 * shim partial

Use **[make:crud](#makecrud)** to create the files necessary to display a view:

* model
* controller
* api controller (if it does not yet exist)
* migration
* test

The **[make:crud](#makecrud)** command also appends to the following files:

* routes.php
* ModelFactory.php
* ApiController (if it already exists)

Use **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** to create all files for crud and views, including:

* model
* controller
* api controller (if it does not yet exist)
* migration
* test
* appropriately-named view folder
* index view
* create view
* edit view
* show view

The **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command also appends to the following files:

* routes.php
* ModelFactory.php
* ApiController (if it already exists)

Please note:

ViewMaker templates assume you use and have a master page. If you don't already have a 
master page, we recommend using our **[make:master](#makemaster)** command, it will include the things you 
need for working ajax calls.

If you don't use our **[make:master](#makemaster)** to create your master page, then you need to make sure you
have the following:

* a master page in a folder named layouts in your views folder
* To use the DataTables template, jquery is a dependency
* jquery must be called first by you (most likely in your masterpage)
* To use the DataTables, you need an @yield('css') tag on your master page
* To use ajax for grids, you need a meta tag for the csrf token in your master page

example for csrf token:

```
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{!! csrf_token() !!}">
```

Our **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** and **[make:crud](#makecrud)** creates everything you need to display views, but if you just
want to use ViewMaker to create views, you will need to write your model, route, migration, and 
controllers in order to be able to see the views created by ViewMaker in your application.

All of these [requirements](#requirements-for-views) are listed in detail below, but since they are common sources of bugs,
I have listed them up here.  You can use it as a check list to make sure you have what you need to
use ViewMaker successfully.

## make:foundation Workflow

To fully understand the power of the **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command, let's walk through a typcial use case.  For this,
we will assume that you have a master page named master.blade.php in your layouts folder, which is in your views folder.
  
If you don't already have a master page, then we recommend using our **[make:master](#makemaster)** command, it will supply
you with everything you need to create a foundation.  Just give your master page a name and supply
an optional name for your app, like so:

```
php artisan make:master master Demo
```

That would create a layouts folder in your views directory and create a master page named master.blade.php.
This would include the dependencies you need for ajax calls and a working data grid.

You can use your own master page, but before we start, let's double check to make sure we have what we need: 

In your masterpage or related partial, you should have your csfr token:

```
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{!! csrf_token() !!}">
```

Your masterpage or related partial should also have your css tag;

```
@yield('css')
```

and in the scripts section of your masterpage or related partial, you should have your call to jquery, for example:

```
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

You need to make sure that is all there before running the command, otherwise
the views containing ajax and grids will not function properly.

Now we're ready to try the **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command.  Let's create a Widget 
foundation with the following command:

```
php artisan make:foundation Widget master dt
```

Widget is the name of the model we want, master is the name of our master page, and dt is the type of template that we want.

After that runs, we're ready to migrate up to our db.  To keep it simple, let's just migrate what we have:

```
php artisan migrate
```

Everything should work at this point, but there is no data.  So let's run a unit test to add 
a single record by running from the command line:

```
vendor/bin/phpunit
```

You should get green and a record in the db. It's a very basic test and it should pass. 

If your test fails:

Some versions of Laravel 5.2 require your routes to be in a web group.  Since 
the new routes we made are just appended to the end of the file, you may need
to move them inside a route group, depending on your version of Laravel.

The test can also fail if another test, like ExampleTest, is having a problem and crashes
the program.  In that case fix or remove the broken tests, and make sure your route group is correct, 
in some versions you need one, in some versions you don't, and that should solve the problem.

Also note, if you are using the **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command and input 'plain' or 'basic' for template
type, the test will fail because it is expecting to see the name of the record on the index page,
and those templates intentionally do not include a way to do that, since the purpose is keep the code minimal.
Similarly, if you choose an index only option, there will be no create view and the test will fail. In those 
cases modify the test as you see fit. 

Next you can use the factory to seed the db.  We start by calling tinker:

```
php artisan tinker
```

Then the following command:

```
factory('App\Widget', 30)->create();
```

Then control D from the command line to quit tinker.

If you don't want to use tinker, manually add some records via the create form.

With that you should be able to go to your /widget route and see the following:

![](dt-index.png)

Please note that the header and footer pictured above are called in by the master page, so 
if you did not use our **[make:master](#makemaster)** command, you will see the output of your masterpage instead or an error if you have no master page.

As you can see the workflow with the **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command is optimal, in under a minute you are able to stand up
a working crud application.  You can then easily modify it to add the fields you want, and you have everything in 
place to support what you need, including all the basics like the model, migration, route and controller, as well 
as a unit test, api controller, and factory method for seeding.  The **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command provides you with a complete foundation to start from.

Also see the [tip for use with make:auth](#tip-for-use-with-makeauth) to see how you can use artisan's native make:auth command to set
up all your auth views to extend the master page you have created with [make:master](#makemaster).

## make:views

The make views lets you quickly scaffold views for create, show, edit, and index, based on your input.

The make:views command has  the following arguments:

```
php artisan make:views {ModelName} {MasterPageName} {TemplateType} {IndexOnly=false}
```
The last argument is optional and indicates that you only want the index view in the view folder.  
By default it is false, which means it's an optional argument, so if you leave it off
entirely, you get all the views.  If you do wish to use that option, you must enter 
the word 'index' as your last argument, no quotes.

Before running make:views, at a minimum, you should already have your model, route and controller created.
As an alternative to doing that manually, you can use **ViewMaker's** **[make:crud](#makecrud)** to do it for you.  Or
you could use **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** to create everything all at once.  If you use **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)**,
you do not need to run make:views, since the views will be included in the foundation.

We recommend using our **[make:master](#makemaster)** command to make your master page.  In any event before you 
run make:views, you need to have your master page ready. Also see [requirements for views](#requirements-for-views). 

So for example, if you had a model named Widget, and you  had a master page 
named master.blade.php, you may do one of the following:

```
php artisan make:views Widget master plain
```

```
php artisan make:views Widget master basic
```

```
php artisan make:views Widget master dt
```

```
php artisan make:views Widget master vue
```

In the examples above, we tell it the model name, 'Widget', the master page name 'master', and the
template type.

The plain template creates simple stubs, the basic template gives you a 
couple of working forms and the dt and vue templates give you a working data 
grid implementation with search and column sorts.  

The templates are described in detail in **[Template Types](#template-types)** section.  Also see the **[Rquirements For Views](#requirements-for-views)**
section to make sure you have what you need before running this.  And finally, check out the conventions
section for naming tips on models and instance variables, so you know what to expect there.

## make:master

ViewMaker's make:master command creates a layouts folder and places a master page and related files in it.

You supply the command with two arguments, the name you want for your master page and the name of your
application.  For example, if we wanted our master page to be called master and our app name was Demo:

```
php artisan make:master master Demo
```

This will create the following:

* layouts folder within the views folder
* master page named by whatever you inputted
* bottom partial
* nav partial
* css partial
* meta partial
* scripts partial
* shim partial

The master page includes the partials and this makes the code very easy to work with.

ViewMaker includes a minimal bootstrap implementation, which you can easily change to suit
your tastes.  Note that inside the css partial, you get the following:

~~~~

<!-- Move style to a permanent home in your main .css file -->
<style>

    body {
        padding-top: 65px; }

</style>

~~~~

This is so the breadcrumbs will show below the nav, which is a bootstrap top pin.  You should move that to a permanent 
home as the comment suggests.  If your main .css already accounts for this padding, you can simply remove this
style from your css.blade.php file.

If you have a .css file that your application requires, you need to call it from your css.blade.php file.
Obviously, you can and should modify these files in any way that suits your application's needs.

Using ViewMaker's make:master also makes it easier to work with the other commands, such as **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)**,
since it is setup for the dependencies that you need.

Note that the second argument in the make:master command is optional.  If you leave it off, for example:

```
php artisan make:master master
```

It will default to naming your app "Demo" in the bootstrap navbar-brand class, which will appear on your top nav.

## Tip for use with make:auth

Here's a tip for using make:master with artisan's native make:auth command.  As you probably already know, the make:auth command will
create all your auth views, extending a master page named app.blade.php.  You can easily use both commands.  Run [make:master](#makemaster) first, but
make sure you do not name your master page 'app,' so there is no conflict with the page that the make:auth command will make.  After
running [make:master](#makemaster), run the make:auth command.  Then all you have to do is go to the views/auth folder and change the @extends('layouts.app') directive
in those view files to @extends('layouts.whatever-your-master-page-is-named').

Please note that the make:auth command also creates a controller that returns the user to a specific page for logging in and 
registering, so you will have to modify that view as well if you want your generated master page extended there as well.

## make:crud

```
php artisan make:crud Widget
```

The make:crud command takes a single argument, the name of the model you wish to build your crud on.  Since
the make:crud command builds the model for you, all you need is a name.  The make:crud command will create
the following file types:

* model
* controller
* api controller (if it does not yet exist)
* migration
* test

It also appends to the following files:

* routes.php
* ModelFactory.php
* ApiController (if it already exists)

You could then run the **[make:views](#makeviews)** command and have it functional, once you've migrated and seeded data or created a 
few records.  Note that the test included with make:crud will fail if you select 'plain' or 'basic' as
your template type because those templates don't output the record name to the index page.  In that 
case modify the test as you see fit.

## make:foundation

The make:foundation command has the following arguments:

```
php artisan make:foundation {ModelName} {MasterPageName} {TemplateType} {IndexOnly=false}
```

The last argument is optional and indicates that you only want the index view in the view folder.  
By default it is false, so unless you indicate otherwise, you will get all the views.  If you do wish
to use that option, you must enter the word 'index' as your last argument, no quotes.

Let's look at some typical examples.  If you wanted to create a model named Widget, and you had a master page 
named master.blade.php, you may do one of the following:

```
php artisan make:foundation Widget master plain
```

```
php artisan make:foundation Widget master basic
```

```
php artisan make:foundation Widget master dt
```

```
php artisan make:foundation Widget master vue
```

make:foundation will create the following:

* model
* controller
* api controller (if it does not yet exist)
* migration
* test
* appropriately-named view folder
* index view
* create view
* edit view
* show view

make:foundation also appends to the following files:

* routes.php
* ModelFactory.php
* ApiController (if it already exists)

Note that the test included with make:foundation will fail if you select 'plain' or 'basic' as
your template type or if you have because those templates don't output the record name to the index page.  
Similarly, if you choose an index only option, there will be no create view and the test will fail. In those 
cases modify the test as you see fit.

## Requirements For Views

To use the **[make:views](#makeviews)** or **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command successfully, you need to have a master page.
We recommend using our **[make:master](#makemaster)** command, it will give you a nice starting point for your project.

If you decide to make the master page yourself, you will need the following:

* a master page in a folder named layouts in your views folder
* To use the DataTables template, jquery is a dependency
* jquery must be called first by you (most likely in your masterpage)
* To use the DataTables, you need an @yield('css') tag on your master page
* To use ajax for grids, you need a meta tag for the csrf token in your master page

example for csrf token:

```
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{!! csrf_token() !!}">
```
 If you need to reference what a master page is, here is the info:
 
[Master Page Docs in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/blade#template-inheritance)

To call in jquery, you may do so by CDN in your scripts section of your master page:

```
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Please refer to the actual CDN for the newest link.

In the css section of your master page or related partial, make sure you have the following:

```
@yield('css')
```

That should come after bootstrap or whatever your main css is.

## Template Types

In the following sections, we cover the template types that are available in the **[make:views](#makeviews)** and **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** commands.

## Plain Templates

Using plain for template type will create a view folder, named according to your input, in your views 
directory.  For example, if you input Widget as the model, you would get a widget view folder. Then 
within that folder, the following files:

* create
* show
* edit
* index

All blade files will extend whatever value for master page that you inputted 
on the command.  In the example above, the master page is named master.blade.php, 
so we used 'master'.  

If for whatever reason you are not using a master page for your application, 
then you will have to go to each file and remove the @extends directive.
  
Since most applications will use a masterpage for common html markup, extending 
the master page is included in the plain templates.

When using plain as the template type, you get the view folder and and the 4 view 
files.  In each file, you get the extends directive and a single \<h1> tag,  
for example in create.blade.php, if you input Widget as your model, you would see:

"This is your Widget Create page"

And thatâ€™s it.  So use plain if you just want to stub out the folder and the files, 
this can still be a time-saver.

## Basic Templates

Many times, we need to do rapid prototyping, so we have a very simple and minimal 
bootstrap implementation named â€˜basicâ€™.   The artisan command is for that is as 
example:

```
php artisan make:views widget master basic
```

Using â€˜basicâ€™ for template type will create a widget folder in your views directory, 
and then within that folder, the following files:

* create
* show
* edit
* index

This will give you an input forms for create and edit and a show page and a simple 
index page.

![basic create view](basic-create.png)

Above you can see that you are provided with a single input for widget name, which 
in the form will be labelled widget_name.  The convention for fieldname is 
$modelName . â€˜_nameâ€™.  If you follow a different convention, then you will have to 
change the value of the field name in all the appropriate spots.  Please see the 
[conventions](#conventions) section for tips on how the templates are formatted.

Note that that the header and footer in the sample above are brought in by extending 
the master page, they will not be generated by the **ViewMaker**.  

The action on the above form is set to POST  to /widget, with the appropriate token set 
to avoid csrf.  That actual posting of the form depends on you having a model, route, 
controller and db setup.  None of that is created for you by **ViewMaker**.  That said, 
these templates are designed to work with a route resource, so if you had the following 
in your routes file:

```
Route::resource('widget', 'WidgetController'):
```

That would obviously point to a WidgetController, which you have to make on your own.  
If you want the form to actually function, you need to write your update method on your 
controller.  

You can see a basic implementation of the model, migration, route, and controller that 
support the basic views at:

[demo](https://github.com/evercode1/package-for-views)

Please note that is the code on github, not a live demo.

Since the templates only provide for a single field, it is easy to add fields, modify 
the html markup and css to suit your own tastes and needs.  Using the **[make:views](#makeviews)** command 
is a starting point that will get you up and running quickly.

## Datatables Templates

Sometimes we need to do quick prototyping of data grids.  With our datatables implementation,
you get all of the views that come with basic, but you get also get a working data grid
on the index page.

Our dt template is a simple implementation of jquery datatables, which can get you up 
and running quickly with a sortable, searchable grid.  The command for that looks like 
this:

```
php artisan make:views widget master dt
```

You can use our **[make:crud](#makecrud)** or **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** command to create the route, model, migration, api route, 
controller, api controller, factory method and test to set up the data you want.

In the event you don't want to use our commands, then you have to do it on your own.  If you do that,
make sure to follow our conventions.  See the conventions section for more details.
  
Assuming you have set up your route, model, migration, api route, 
and controller, and have some records, the dt template will get you the following:

![](dt-index.png)

Again note the header and footer are brought in by master page, which you create 
separately.  We recommend our make:master command for creating master page because it will
set the dependcies for the views.

When you run the **[make:views](#makeviews)** command with â€˜dtâ€™, you get two additional view pages.  
One is datatable.blade.php, which holds the table partial.  The other is 
datatable-script.blade.php, which holds the datatable script.

The datatable-script.blade.php is a temporary home for your script.  You should move  your 
datatable-script.blade js code to a permanent home, such as in public/js folder 
or assets/js or some other location for your js assets.  Itâ€™s up to you how you 
want to organize that.

As mentioned numerous times throughout the documentation, that you need the following meta tag:

```
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{!! csrf_token() !!}">
```

The easiest way to make sure you have all the configuration correct is to use our **[make:master](#makemaster)**
command for your master page, it will include the above meta tag.

You can see how I did all this in the demo app:

[demo](https://github.com/evercode1/package-for-views)

Please note that is the code, not a live demo.  But you can see how I structured the 
master page and the cdn calls.

In addition to having the route resource and matching controller, you also need a route 
for your api call, which again, using widget as an example, would be:

```
Route::any('api/widget', 'ApiController@widgetData');
```

Please note that this is provided with our **[make:crud](#makecrud)** and **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** commands.

This route assumes you have a controller named ApiController, which are also provided by
**[make:crud](#makecrud)** and **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)**.  

Iâ€™m using any as the verb here so I can do a get request to debug.  You also need to format 
the json response a specific way,  so for example, you api controller could look like this:

~~~~

<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

use App\Http\Requests;
use DB;

class ApiController extends Controller
{
   public function widgetData(){

       $result['data'] = DB::table('widgets')
                       ->select('id',
                                'widget_name',
                                'created_at')
                       ->get();

       return json_encode($result);

   }
}

~~~~

Obviously, you can add new columns to the select statement as you require them, as long 
as you have added them in your db.  You would also have to have a corresponding table 
row on your datatable.blade.php partial.  And of course you would have to modify your 
script to account for additional columns.

Datatables is a popular jquery plugin, the docs are here:

[Datatables](https://datatables.net/)

## Vue.js Templates

Sometimes we need to do quick prototyping of data grids and we want to use vue.js.
With our vue.js implementation, you get all of the views that come with basic, but 
you get also get a working data grid on the index page.

Our vue template is a simple implementation of a vue.js grid component, which can get you up 
and running quickly with a sortable, searchable grid.  The command for that looks like 
this:

```
php artisan make:views widget master vue
```

Assuming you have some records, and have set up your route, model, migration, api route, 
and controller, that will get you the following on your index page:

![](vue-index.png)

Again note the header and footer are brought in by master page, which you create 
separately on your own.  Though not shown in the image, as of version 3.1.2. the vue template
has pagination.

You also need a meta tag, which will create the tokens for your ajax calls,
so put it in the appropriate place in your head section:

```
<meta name="csrf-token" content="{!! csrf_token() !!}">
```
You can see how I did all this in the demo app:

[demo](https://github.com/evercode1/package-for-views)

I break out my meta section as a view partial, which gets called into master.blade.php,
but you can do it any way you want as long as you have it in there correctly.

Please note that is the code, not a live demo.  But you can see how I structured the 
master page and the cdn calls.  This is exactly what our **[make:master](#makemaster)** command creates.

When you run the **[make:views](#makeviews)** command with â€˜vueâ€™, you get your script, template, and css
all included on the same index page.  You also get create.blade.php, edit.blade.php, and show.blade.php,
but those are the same as the basic template, so refer to that for what those will look like.

The ViewMaker will get you up and running quickly, but you should move your 
vue js code to a permanent home, such as in public/js folder 
or assets/js or some other location for your js assets.  Itâ€™s up to you how you 
want to organize that.  The same is true for the css that I provided for it.

In addition to having the route resource and matching controller, you also need a route 
for your api call, which again, using widget as an example, would be:

```
Route::any('api/widget-vue', 'ApiController@widgetVueData');
```

Note: this is a different convention than the datatables version.

The route assumes you have a controller named ApiController with a widgetVueData method.  Oviously,
if your model is something other than Widget, you would substitute the model name for widget.

Our **[make:crud](#makecrud)** and **[make:foundation](#makefoundation)** commands will build the controller for you or you have to do it on
your own.

Iâ€™m using any as the verb here so I can do a get request to debug.  As a basic example, your api controller could look 
like this:

~~~~

<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

use App\Http\Requests;
use DB;

class ApiController extends Controller
{
   public function widgetVueData()
       {
   
           $widgets = DB::table('widgets')
                    ->select('id as Id',
                             'widget_name as Name',
                             'created_at as Created')
                    ->paginate(10);
   
           return response()->json($widgets);
   
       }
}

~~~~

Obviously, you can add new columns to the select statement as you require them, as long 
as you have added them in your db.  You would also have to have a corresponding table 
row in your grid on the index view and add the column name or names in the vue component.

Vue.js is a popular javascript library, the docs are here:

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

What you get is a working, ajax-powered vue.js grid, but it's just a starting point.  If you 
are just starting with Vue, it will give you some idea of how it works.

If you are using our make:foundation or make:crud command to create your routes, models, controllers, etc, these are the conventions they follow, but all the work is done for you, so you don't have to worry about missing something.

If you are making your own models, routes, controllers, etc., it's important to reference things correctly or the views will not work.

## Models

When inputting model names, you have some options.  Ultimately ViewMaker will convert it to the proper format as long as it close.

The best way to input the model name is to stick with Laravelâ€™s conventions.  Here are a couple of examples:

~~~~

php artisan make:views Widget master dt

~~~~

For compound words:

~~~~

php artisan make:views BigWidget master dt

~~~~

To make things easier, and to not have to delete a lot of files over a typo, I built in some flexibility into how you can supply the model name to the commands.

For models with a single word, you can also use the lowercase version of the word as the first argument of the command:

~~~~

php artisan make:foundation widget master dt

~~~~


In this case, widget represents the Widget model. ViewMaker will convert it automatically to uppercase for use in the appropriate places in the templates.

If you have model with compound words, for example, AlphaWidget, then you can type it as the lowercase, separated by a dash:

~~~~

php artisan make:foundation alpha-widget master dt

~~~~


Note, whether you use AlphaWidget or alpha-widget, your route would be:

~~~~

Route::resource('alpha-widget', 'AlphaWidgetController');

~~~~

ViewMaker, as I mentioned also in chapter 3, will convert plural in model names to singular, which is a handy protector against making mistakes.


## Routes

Routes for models with a single word take on the lowercase value of the model. For example, for the Widget model, you would have the following route:

~~~~

Route::resource('widget', 'WidgetController');

~~~~


Routes for models made up of compound words, will have a dash separating them. For example, for the AlphaWidget model, you would have the following route:

~~~~

Route::resource('alpha-widget', 'AlphaWidgetController');

~~~~
## Api Routes

If you wish the ajax calls to work out of the box for datatables and vue.js, then you need to follow the conventions when naming the api routes, assuming you are not using make:foundation to build them for you.

The following routes are an example for the datatables api routes.

Single word model:

~~~~

Route::any('api/widget', 'ApiController@widgetData');

~~~~


Multiple world model:

~~~~

Route::any('api/alpha-widget', 'ApiController@alphaWidgetData');

~~~~


For vue.js, use the following api route convention:

~~~~

Route::any('api/widget-vue', 'ApiController@widgetVueData');

~~~~


For multiple word models and using vue.js:

~~~~

Route::any('api/beta-widget-vue', 'ApiController@betaWidgetVueData');

~~~~


You are free to deviate from this as you wish, however you will need to overwrite the parts of the index.blade.php file that make the api call with your own values.
## View Folder Conventions

View folders will be created with the lowercase string value of the model name. If you have a multi-word model, for example, AlphaWidget, the name of your view folder would also be alpha-widget, so in your controller methods, you do the following for create view for example:

____________________________________________________________________________

~~~~

public function create()
{
   return view('alpha-widget.create');
}

~~~~

____________________________________________________________________________


## Field Names

As I mention in the other section, the templates are built with a single field, with the following convention:

~~~~

$modelName . '_name'

~~~~


So that would mean that you have to have a widget_name column in your db, if you are following the Widget model example. 

A quick note on why I do it this way. You could have several models with a name attribute. By making the model part of the name of the attribute, there is never confusion between widget_name and product_name, for example, and that makes working with queries easier in the long run.

This convention will work great in most cases, but obviously there are some cases where it will have to be changed, for example if want to use it on a user model, you would end up with user_name, which in the migration in Laravel is actually just â€˜nameâ€™. Stick with Laravel defaults if you can.

So if you have situation like that or if you use a different convention, itâ€™s ok, just change it after the files are made. You will have to work on these files anyway, since itâ€™s unlikely you will build models with a single field name. At any rate, itâ€™s meant to be a starting point, a fast way to get up and running.

Also note that this convention is only for the initial field supplied with the template. Any fields that you add to your models and tables are completely at your discretion, since you will have to add those yourself anyway.

I hope you enjoy this plugin and find it useful.  I donâ€™t have a donate button, but If you would like 
to support my work and learn more about Laravel, you can do so by buying one of 
my books, **[Laraboot: laravel 5.2 For Beginners](https://leanpub.com/laravel-5-for-beginners-laraboot)**, 
I really appreciate it.
